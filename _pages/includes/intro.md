<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am now a scientific researcher in Interaction Intelligence Lab, Ant Research. Prior to this, I was a senior researcher, leading the projects of ***neural rendering*** and ***2D avatar*** in Tencent AI Lab. I recieved Ph.D. degree from School of Computer Science and Technology, Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2019 under the supervision of [Prof. Fei Wang](http://www.aiar.xjtu.edu.cn/info/1046/1242.htm) and [Prof. Jizhong Zhao](http://pvc.xjtu.edu.cn/info/1010/1058.htm). I was a visiting student at NICTA in 2015 supervised by [Dr. Mathieu Salzmann](https://people.epfl.ch/mathieu.salzmann). I received Master degree from School of Software Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2010, and received Bachelor degree from Department of Computer Science and Technology, Xi'an University of Science and Technology in 2007. My research interests include neural rendering(e.g. NeRF), non-rigid 3d reconstruction, performance capture, image synthesis and relevant applications. At present, we attempt to create the highly photorealistic and fully controllable digital content including human avatar and scenarios.
