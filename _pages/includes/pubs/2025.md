- This work focuses on open-domain 4D avatarization, with the purpose of creating a 4D avatar from a portrait image in an arbitrary style. Extensive experiments suggest that our model, termed AvatarArtist, is capable of producing high-quality 4D avatars with strong robustness to various source image domains.

- We present a hybrid explicit representation to combine the strengths of different geometric primitives, which adaptively models rich texture on smooth surfaces as well as complex geometric structures simultaneously.
- To avoid artifacts created by facet-crossing Gaussian splats, we design a stable depth sorting strategy based on the rasterization results of the mesh and 3DGS.
- We incorporate the proposed hybrid explicit representation into modeling 3D head avatars, which render more fidelity images in real time.
